# Smart-Shopping-Cart
A multi-controller product prototype using BeagleBone Green, TIVA C-Series launchpad development board along with sensors, actuators and display devices

## Introduction
Quick and cashless transactions have become the need of the hour, particularly at places like supermarkets where one has to put in ample amount of time looking for the regular products. According to a survey by Time Use Institute, at an average a person spends 41 minutes per trip at the supermarket. This sums up to an average of 53 hours per year when multiplied by the average number of trips per week. All this time can be saved by employing a much smarter approach to our daily shopping trips. Smart cart is one of the many solutions to reduce your shopping time. What we intend to do in this project is explained in great detail in the following sections.

### BUILD STEPS
1) Git clone https://github.com/sorabhgandhi01/Smart-Shopping-Cart. 
2) To build remote node code, import the "FreeRTOS_tiva_Remote_Node" in Code Composer Studio.
3) Build it and flash it on the TIVA C SERIES TM4C1294XL board.
4) To build the control node code, compile the code inside BBG folder by doing a "make" on Linux Command Line terminal.
5) An executable will be generated by the name "control_node".
6) Run the exe file by writing a command $./control_node.
7) Simultaneously, run the code on TIVA C SERIES TM4C1294XL.
